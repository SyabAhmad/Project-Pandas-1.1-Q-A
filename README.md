# Pandas Practice Questions
This repository contains a list of practice questions for working with Pandas, a popular data analysis library for Python. The questions cover a wide range of topics, from basic data manipulation to advanced techniques for working with time-series data and statistical analysis.

The questions are divided into two sections: 10 basic questions and 20 advanced questions. The basic questions cover the basics of working with Pandas DataFrames, including selecting columns, filtering rows, and creating new columns. The advanced questions cover more advanced topics, such as merging DataFrames, resampling time-series data, and performing statistical analysis.

Each question is accompanied by a brief description of the problem and an example solution using Pandas. These examples are intended to help you understand the problem and give you a starting point for your own solutions.

To use these practice questions, you should have some basic knowledge of Python and Pandas. If you're new to Pandas, we recommend starting with the official Pandas documentation, which provides a comprehensive introduction to the library.

We hope you find these practice questions helpful in your journey to mastering Pandas!
